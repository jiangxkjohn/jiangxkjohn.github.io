## Project & Competition

---

### **Intelligent Home Service Robot Technology and System**

Funded by **National Key R&D Program of China**  
Jan.2019 - Present

* Calibrated the infrared camera and kinect camera
to solve the translation and rotation relative between them,
then fuse the thermal graph and RGBD graph to acquire a
matched graph showing the temperature and RGBD information.

* Used laser to map the indoor environment, then generated
2D map for navigation. Utilized A* as global path planner and
Time Elastic band as local path planner.

* Installed a QR scanner in the bottom of the robot,
so the scanner can scan the QR code set in the goal to get the pose deviation,
then the robot adjusted the pose of robot more precisely

### **The Design of Intelligent Disinfection Robot**

National Third Prize in China Postgraduate Robot Innovation and Design Competition  
Jun.2020 - Sept.2020  

* Worked as project leader and organized all the team research and development work  
* Constructed the outline of the robot system which include
the mapping, navigation, disinfection mechanism,
auto body temperature, mask detection and human interaction part.
* Developed an Android app by java to control the robot,
utilized the ROS Bridge to communicate with the Android device.
* Developed the local planner via deep reinforcement learning
to avoid the moving crowd, then integrated them to the move_base.
* Deployed the face detection and mask detection model in the ROS.

### **RoboMaster 2020 AI Challenge**

Second Prize in Decision Group  
First Prize in Open Source Awards  
Second Prize in Navigation and Motion Planning Group  
Third Prize in Navigation and Motion Planning Group  
Oct.2019 - Sept.2020

* Utilized the Dueling DQN to establish decision network by tensorflow,
this network uses the observation of all the robots included
position, blood, ammo as input and
outputs the actions of two robots in our side team.
Then I trained network to let the agent learn to avoid the
obstacles and attack the enemies. The results showed that
the agent we trained had a win rate over 80% in the competition
with the random strategy.
* Developed a gym environment to simulate the behavior of
four robots in two teams, the environment can simulate the
moving of robot and detect whether the robot interact with
the obstacles or other robots
* Code the visual part to make the decision process visible

### **All-weather 500 KV HV transmission line inspection robot**

Jan.2019 - May.2020

* Used Adams to analyses the mechanical model
* Detected the items in transmission line via YOLO v3
