### Master student in Mechanical Engineering

**State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System**  
**Harbin Institute of Technology**  
Sept.2019 - Present  

### Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering

Outstanding Graduate  
**Harbin Institute of Technology**  
Sept.2015 - Jun.2019  

## Project & Competition

---

### **Intelligent Home Service Robot Technology and System**

Funded by **National Key R&D Program of China**  
Jan.2019 - Present

* Calibrated the infrared camera and kinect camera
to solve the translation and rotation relative between them,
then fuse the thermal graph and RGBD graph.

* Maped the indoor environment using laser,
and then navigate the robot via move_base package

* Used the QR scanner to scan the QR code set in the goal,
then adjust the pose of robot more precisely

### **The Design of Intelligent Disinfection Robot**

**National Third Prize in China Postgraduate Robot Innovation and Design Competition**  
Jun.2020 - Sept.2020  

* Worked as project leader and organized all the team research work  
* Contracted the outline of the robot system which include six main part
which include the mapping, navigation, disinfection mechanism,
auto body temperature and mask detection and human interaction part
* Designed the local planner via deep reinforcement learning
to avoid the moving crowd, then integrate them to the move_base

### **RoboMaster 2020 AI Challenge**

**Second Prize in Decision Group**  
**First Prize in Open Source Awards**  
**Second Prize in Navigation and Motion Planning Group**  
**Third Prize in Navigation and Motion Planning Group**  
Oct.2019 - Sept.2020

* Used Dueling DQN as the decision part of robot,
input the observation of all the robots to the network,
then the network would output the actions of two robots in one team.
* Constructed a gym environment to simulate the behavior of
four robots in two teams, the environment can simulate the
moving of robot and detect whether the robot interact with
the obstacles or other robots
* Code the visual part to make
the decision process visible

### **All-weather 500 KV HV transmission line inspection robot**

Jan.2019 - May.2020

* Used Adams to analyses the mechanical model
* Detected the items in transmission line via YOLO v3
