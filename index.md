## Project & Competition

---

### **Intelligent Home Service Robot Technology and System**

Funded by **National Key R&D Program of China**  
*Jan.2019 - Present*

* Calibrated the infrared camera and kinect camera
to solve the translation and rotation relative between them,
then fuse the thermal graph and RGBD graph to acquire a
matched graph showing the temperature and RGBD information.

* Used laser to map the indoor environment, then generated
2D map for navigation. Utilized A* as global path planner and
Time Elastic band as local path planner. The global planner
is used for planning a global path and the local planner is
used for collision avoidance.

* Installed a QR scanner in the bottom of the robot,
so the scanner can scan the QR code set in the goal to get the pose deviation,
then the robot adjusted the pose of robot more precisely.

* Assisted the development of 3D thermal mapping via ORB-SLAM2,
I used the YOLOv3 to detect the people in the camera, and then delete
the futures in the bounding box labeled by person. I also did some work
in thermal mapping visualization using OpenGL.

### **The Design of Intelligent Disinfection Robot**

National Third Prize in China Postgraduate Robot Innovation and Design Competition  
*Jun.2020 - Sept.2020*  

* Worked as project leader and organized all the team research and development work.
* Constructed the outline of the robot system which include
the mapping, navigation, disinfection mechanism,
auto body temperature, mask detection and human interaction part.
* Developed the local planner via deep reinforcement learning
to avoid the moving crowd, then integrated them to the move_base.
* Developed an Android app by java to control the robot,
utilized the ROS Bridge to communicate with the Android device.
* Deployed the face detection and mask detection model in the ROS.

### **RoboMaster 2020 AI Challenge**

Second Prize in Decision Group  
First Prize in Open Source Awards  
Second Prize in Navigation and Motion Planning Group  
Third Prize in Navigation and Motion Planning Group  
*Oct.2019 - Sept.2020*

* Utilized the Dueling DQN to establish decision network by tensorflow,
this network uses the observation of all the robots included
position, blood, ammo as input and
outputs the actions of two robots in our side team.
Then I trained network to let the agent learn to avoid the
obstacles and attack the enemies. The results showed that
the agent we trained had a win rate over 80\% in the competition
with the random strategy.
* Developed a gym environment to simulate the behavior of
four robots in two teams, the environment can simulate the
moving of robot and detect whether the robot interact with
the obstacles or other robots.
* Developed the visual interface using pyplet to make the
decision process visible.

### **All-weather 500 KV HV transmission line inspection robot**

Cooperated with **China Southern Power Grid Company**  
*Jan.2019 - May.2020*

* Used Adams to analyses the mechanical model of inspection robot,
and verified if the mechanics structure is able to meet the requirement
of climbing and the stability.
* Collected very few number of four typical items
in the transmission line because of the difficulty to collect them
in transmission line, then we augment the data to generate a large
number of random labeled image by the matches between raw image and raw labels.
* utilized YOLO v4 to train a object detection model in the dataset we acquired.
Then we use depth information to filter the background and got a higher mAP and accuracy.
